# Remote Control Interface

A web-based Remote Control Interface that enables users to send commands to a connected device using Socket.io. This interface includes functionalities such as sending alerts, notifications, vibrations, and more.

## Features

-User-Friendly Interface**: Simple design with an intuitive dropdown for command selection.
-Command Options: 
  - Alert: Trigger an alert dialog.
  - Send Notification**: Send a test notification to the device.
  - Vibrate: Make the device vibrate.
  - Flicker: Create a flickering effect on the device's display.
  - Ring: Play a ringing sound on the device.
  - Freeze/Unfreeze: Temporarily freeze the device's interface and restore functionality.
- Real-time Communication: Uses Socket.io for real-time event-based communication between the client and server.
- Mobile Optimization: Designed for both desktop and mobile usage, with adjustments for screen size.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend functionality and command handling.
- **Node.js**: Backend server framework.
- **Socket.io**: Library for real-time communication.

## How It Works

1. **Interface**: Users select a command from the dropdown menu and click the "Send Command" button.
2. **Socket Communication**: The command is sent to the server using Socket.io, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients.
3. **Feedback**: The server logs the received commands, providing real-time feedback in the console.

## Mobile Support

The interface is responsive, hiding the command selection on mobile devices and displaying a welcome message instead. Users on mobile can still interact with the interface.

## Precautions

- **Use Responsibly**: This interface is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Ensure you have proper authorization before sending commands to any device.
- **Device Compatibility**: Ensure the target device supports the commands being sent to avoid unintended behavior.
- **Data Privacy**: Do not transmit sensitive or personal data through this interface.
