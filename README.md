# Remote Control Interface

A web-based Remote Control Interface that enables users to send commands to a connected device using Socket.io. This interface includes functionalities such as sending alerts, notifications, vibrations, and more.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple design with an intuitive dropdown for command selection.
- **Command Options**: 
  - **Alert**: Trigger an alert dialog.
  - **Send Notification**: Send a test notification to the device.
  - **Vibrate**: Make the device vibrate.
  - **Flicker**: Create a flickering effect on the device's display.
  - **Ring**: Play a ringing sound on the device.
  - **Freeze/Unfreeze**: Temporarily freeze the device's interface and restore functionality.
- **Real-time Communication**: Uses Socket.io for real-time event-based communication between the client and server.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Designed for both desktop and mobile usage, with adjustments for screen size.

## Demo

[Include a link to a live demo or screenshots if available.]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remote-control-interface.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd remote-control-interface
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5500` to access the interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend functionality and command handling.
- **Node.js**: Backend server framework.
- **Socket.io**: Library for real-time communication.

## How It Works

1. **Interface**: Users select a command from the dropdown menu and click the "Send Command" button.
2. **Socket Communication**: The command is sent to the server using Socket.io, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients.
3. **Feedback**: The server logs the received commands, providing real-time feedback in the console.

## Mobile Support

The interface is responsive, hiding the command selection on mobile devices and displaying a welcome message instead. Users on mobile can still interact with the interface.

## Precautions

- **Use Responsibly**: This interface is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Ensure you have proper authorization before sending commands to any device.
- **Device Compatibility**: Ensure the target device supports the commands being sent to avoid unintended behavior.
- **Data Privacy**: Do not transmit sensitive or personal data through this interface.
